The point of the software is to make a tool that helps 
play around with curves.
One use is just to have fun, another is to create graphic expressions
that look like height curves (much like a map),
another is to be able create GCODE for use in CNC/milling.

Compile it this way:
javac *.java

Run it like this:
java Intrpol

Then put down a number of points, at least three,
then click Expand followed by Interpolate.

At the moment I use to create a Postscript file
which is printed on overhead plastic, and then used for
a print using photopolymer gravure.
This is accomplished using File>Bezier curve as postscript.

This sends ps commands to standard out, so you might want to redirect
that to a file.
