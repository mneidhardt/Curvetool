Curvetool, mapmaker, intrpol - I will eventually find a lasting name.
The point of the software is to make a tool that helps 
play around with curves.
One use is just to have fun, another is to create graphic expressions
that look like height curves (much like a map),
another is to be able create GCODE for use in CNC/milling.
